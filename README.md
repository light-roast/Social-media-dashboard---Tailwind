## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This is a hands on experience project to practice the knowledge adquired by the course "Curso a fondo de Tailwind" by Código facilito. I learn how o correctly implement a dark-light mode switcher (from the creation of the switch itself to the implementation of this functionality).

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/).
